			<h2>My Portfolio<br /></h2>
		</header>
		<p>Welcome to my Computer Science portfolio, a curated collection of my technical pursuits and digital
			adventures. With a fervent curiosity for all things code and an unwavering dedication to problem-solving, I
			invite you to delve into the world of algorithms, data structures, and software development that defines my
			journey.I have come a long way and my technical and coding skills exceeded my expectations.In the beginning
			I thought I would be just an ordinary dev but I guess that changed through practice.Since I made more
			projects I thought I should update my website.You can download my projects in Github but you can view them
			here.Now I am busy because I am about to get my degree but afterwards I will have all the time in the world.
			Personally I would like to get started with game development.In this part of my life I am almost alone
			because I ain't have many business partners for this part of my life but I wll get to it.Fortunately my best
			friend is trying to learn too and I have someone to talk about that kind of stuff.
