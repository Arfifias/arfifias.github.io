			<h2>My Portfolio<br /></h2>
		</header>
		<p>Welcome to my Computer Science portfolio, a curated collection of my technical pursuits and digital
			adventures. With a fervent curiosity for all things code and an unwavering dedication to problem-solving, I
			invite you to delve into the world of algorithms, data structures, and software development that defines my
			journey. I have come a long way and my technical and coding skills exceeded my expectations. In the
			beginning
			I thought I would be just an ordinary dev but I guess that changed through practice as time went by.
			Since I made more projects I thought I should update my website. You can download my projects in Github but
			you can view themhere.
			Now I am busy because I am about to get my degree but afterwards I will have all the time in the
			world.
			After three years in college I managed to pass my dissertation which was about Movies in Box Office and
			their analysis, basically analyzing movies by making machine learning models with an indicator of success,
			based on some factors like budget of the scenes, audience and popularity, expenses and most important the
			gross of the movie.
			All that information was stored in an excel file and actually I used methods like Data Mining and Data
			Analysis to shape the file.
			After the final file of my data was created I used MATLAB's tools to create the Machine Learning models,
			specifically Regression and Classification Learners, with successful models having an average perchentage of
			40 to 45 percent of being accurate. The low perchentage was due to some complications like excluding or
			including important factors but for machine learning these kinds of perchentage aren't the best but
			acceptable.

		<p>Based on my experience I have obtained skills that are useful for my coding process like error handling and
			of course debugging. I really enjoy coding in Backend languages because that's where I actually started but
			that does not mean that I won't code in any language I know if possible.....it just takes some impressions
			first and of course with the right people (Friendly Reminder: I do not work for toxic people or toxic
			enviroments). Anything else you want to ask me please don't be shy to contact me!!!</p>
